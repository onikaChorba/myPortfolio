# 👩‍💻 Welcome to my portfolio site created with React!

The portfolio site has been designed with a focus on both functionality and aesthetics, incorporating various techniques to create an engaging and visually appealing website. 

On the homepage, you'll find a brief introduction about me and my skills. You can also navigate to my projects page where you can see some of my recent work. Each project card includes a brief description and a link to the live site or code repository.

## 🛠️ Used metods and tools

### ⛳️ creative simple functional component and class component

I used React's functional components and the useState hook to build this site. React's functional components make it easy to create reusable code and keep our code organized. useState hook allowed me to manage state within functional components, which is great for building interactive user interfaces.

### 🗂️ using props to pass data from from a parent component to a child components 

To transfer data between components, props are used, which simplifies the data flow and makes the code more readable.

### 🚀 using useState, useEffect

The site also employs React's useState, useEffect, and useMemo hooks, which are essential tools for state management, component lifecycle management, and performance optimization, respectively. By leveraging these hooks, the site can respond to user interactions quickly and efficiently.

### 🚴‍♀️ creation of simple forms for interaction with the user 

The portfolio site also features simple forms that enable user interaction and provide a seamless user experience. By leveraging React's form handling capabilities, the site can process user input quickly and efficiently, resulting in a smooth and satisfying user experience.

### 📱 adaptation to different screen sizes

The use of responsive design ensures that the site remains functional and visually appealing on devices of various sizes. This makes the site accessible to a broader range of users and ensures that they can enjoy the site's full functionality regardless of the device they are using. 

### 🔥 site deployed to the github-pages environment by the pages build and deployment workflow

This ensures that the site is available to users worldwide and can be accessed from any device with an internet connection.

### 🪢 using canvas to create animations

Using canvas to create animations is a powerful technique that can add an engaging and interactive element to a website. Methods of React was utilized to update the canvas in response to user input or changes in the application's data.
